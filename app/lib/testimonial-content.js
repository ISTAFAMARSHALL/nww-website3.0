    content: `Adam and I have been ‚Äútrying‚Äù to re-connect for over a year and finally did so while I waited for my bus in glorious Port Authority. He mentioned this lunch thing and soon enough I found myself trekking to Hoboken for what felt like just another business lunch to meet other people that probably also worked in Financial Services.

    Well.. I was wrong. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. This was not anything close to a typical networking event. It was a small group, with no one in the same career or industry as me and it also wasn‚Äôt about work. It was about the underlying human that also happens to have a career.

    Amazing food, can‚Äôt stress that enough, great interesting and fascinating people from different walks of life gathered together for a shared goal; to connect.

    How often do we find ourselves surprised in a good way, or unable to research something that we‚Äôre about to do?

    Thank you Adam R. Connors for creating a mid-day and mid-week opportunity to remind me of what to be thankful for!`,

You may think it is going to be a long day, leaving Long Island at * AM to head to the 6th Borough Hoboken for lunch, only to get home at 7:30 PM, but it was the best use of twelve hours of my life. I had a great number of JOYful conversations and met some great people who brought JOY to my own life.

    Make sure you carve out the time, come to lunch and add some JOy to your life, Adam R. Connors will make sure that happens!`,

    Adam did an outstanding job curating the guest list and facilitating engaging discussions that spanned a variety of important topics. Each conversation was not only insightful but also enriched by the collective expertise and perspectives of the attendees.

    The food was absolutely fantastic, adding an extra layer of delight to our meetings. It's clear that every detail was thoughtfully considered to create a welcoming and intellectually stimulating environment.

    Thank you, Adam, for your excellent curation and for providing us with such a wonderful platform for connection and growth. I am already looking forward to future events and the chance to deepen the connections made.`,
